6            Research into the etiology of schizophrenia has never been as interesting or as
7            provocative as in the past three years. There has been progress on several fronts, but
8            particularly regarding the molecular genetics of this complex disorder of mind and brain.
9            At the same time, a number of critically important and unresolved issues remain that
10            qualify the ultimate clinical and scientific validity of the results. However, the recent
11            progress in this historically difficult area of inquiry does not seem to be widely
12            appreciated. The purpose of this article is to provide a high-level review of progress, its
13            limitations, and the implications for clinical research and clinical practice.
14            The public health importance of schizophrenia is clear. The median lifetime prevalence
15            of schizophrenia is 0.7–0.8% [1], with onset typically ranging from adolescence to early
16            adulthood and a course of illness typified by exacerbations, remissions, and substantial
17            residual symptoms and functional impairment [2]. Morbidity is substantial, and
18            schizophrenia ranks ninth in global burden of illness [3]. In addition, schizophrenia is
19            often comorbid with drug dependence (principally alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, and cocaine)
20            and important medical conditions (obesity, Type 2 diabetes mellitus) [4]. Mortality due to
21            natural and unnatural causes is considerable, and the projected lifespan for individuals
22            with schizophrenia is some 15 years less than the general population [5]. The personal,
23            familial, and societal costs of schizophrenia are enormous.

25          
26            Etiological Clues
27            A substantial body of epidemiological research has established a set of risk factors for
28            schizophrenia. A subset of this work is summarized in Figure 1. Of a large set of pre- and
29            antenatal risk factors [6], having a first-degree relative with schizophrenia is associated
30            with an odds ratio of almost ten. The general impact of some of the risk factors in Figure
31            1 remains uncertain, and, additionally, migrant status, urban residence, cannabis use, and
32            biological sex are supported as risk factors for schizophrenia. Although the attributable
33            risk of some of these risk factors may be greater (e.g., place and season of birth) [7],
34            the size of the odds ratio for family history suggests that searching for the familial
35            determinants of schizophrenia is rational for etiological research.
36          
37          
38            Unpacking the Family History Risk Factor
39            Studies of families, adoptees, and twins have been widely used to attempt to understand
40            the relative contributions of genetic and environmental effects upon risk for
41            schizophrenia. These “old genetics” approaches use phenotypic resemblance of relatives as
42            an indirect means by which to infer the roles of genes and environment. There are many
43            important assumptions and methodological issues with these studies [8]; however, genetic
44            epidemiological studies of schizophrenia have yielded a remarkably consistent set of
45            findings, as summarized in Table 1 [9, 10].
46            To summarize this literature briefly, schizophrenia is familial, or “runs” in families.
47            Both adoption and twin studies indicate that the familiality of schizophrenia is due mainly
48            to genetic effects. Twin studies suggest the relevance of small but significant shared
49            environmental influences that are likely prenatal in origin. Thus, schizophrenia is best
50            viewed as a complex trait resulting from both genetic and environmental etiological
51            influences. These results are only broadly informative, as they provide no information
52            about the location of the genes or the identity of the environmental factors that
53            predispose or protect against schizophrenia. Searching for genetic influences that mediate
54            vulnerability to schizophrenia is rational, given the larger overall effect size and lesser
55            error of measurement in comparison to typical assessments of environmental effects. Note
56            that high heritability is no guarantee of success in efforts to identify candidate
57            genes.

59          
60            Genomewide Linkage Studies of Schizophrenia
61            Modern genotyping technologies and statistical analyses have enabled the discovery of
62            genetic loci related to the etiology of many complex traits [11], such as Type 2 diabetes
63            mellitus, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease. These “discovery science” approaches have been
64            applied to schizophrenia, and are summarized in Figure 2. The 27 samples shown here
65            included from one to 294 multiplex pedigrees (see Glossary) (median 34) containing 32 to
66            669 (median 101) individuals affected with a narrow definition of schizophrenia. There were
67            310 to 950 (median 392) genetic markers in the first-stage genome scans.
68            “Hard” replication—implication of the same markers, alleles, and haplotypes in the
69            majority of samples—is elusive. It is evident from Figure 2 that these studies are
70            inconsistent, and no genomic region was implicated in more than four of the 27 samples. The
71            Lewis et al. meta-analysis [12] included most of the studies in Figure 2 and found that one
72            region on Chromosome 2 was stringently significant and several additional regions neared
73            significance. Our focus on first-stage genome scans does not adequately capture the
74            evidence supporting replication for certain regions (e.g., 6p) [13–18]. However, there
75            appears to be “soft” replication across studies.
76            It is unlikely that all of these linkage findings are true. The regions suggested by the
77            Lewis et al. meta-analysis implicate more than 3,000 genes (18% of all known genes). For
78            the 27 samples in Figure 2, the percentages of all known genes implicated by 0, 1, 2, 3,
79            and 4 linkage studies were 42%, 35%, 14%, 6%, and 3%, respectively. This crude summation
80            suggests that linkage analysis is an imprecise tool—implausibly large numbers of genes are
81            implicated and few genes are consistently identified in more than a small subset of
82            studies.
83            There are several potential reasons why clear-cut or “hard” replication was not found.
84            With respect to the teams that conducted these enormously effortful studies, it is possible
85            that no study possessed sufficient statistical power to detect the subtle genetic effects
86            suspected for schizophrenia. For example, it would require 4,900 pedigrees to have 80%
87            power to detect a locus accounting for 5% of variance in liability to schizophrenia at α =
88            0.001. These calculations make highly optimistic assumptions, and less favorable
89            assumptions can lead to sample size requirements above 50,000 sibling pairs. For
90            comparison, the total number of pedigrees in Figure 2 is less than 2,000.
91            In addition, it is possible that etiological heterogeneity (different combinations of
92            genetic and environmental causes between samples) and technical differences (different
93            ascertainment, assessment, genotyping, and statistical analysis between samples)
94            contributed; however, their impact is uncertain, whereas insufficient power is clear. If
95            correct, the implication is that Figure 2 contains a mix of true and false positive
96            findings.

98          
99            Association Studies of Schizophrenia
100            Schizophrenia—like most other complex traits in biomedicine—has had a large number of
101            genetic case-control association studies [19]. Although research practice is changing,
102            interpretation of many studies is hindered by small sample sizes and a tendency to genotype
103            a single genetic marker of the hundreds that might be available in a gene. For example, a
104            widely studied functional genetic marker in 
105            COMT (rs4680) is probably not associated with schizophrenia [20], but
106            nearby genetic markers assessed in a minority of studies may be [21].
107            However, as discussed in the next section, a number of methodologically adequate
108            association studies of schizophrenia appear to support the role of several candidate genes
109            in the etiology of schizophrenia. Similar to the linkage study data, “hard” replication
110            remains elusive.
111          
112          
113            Synthesis
114            Despite the limitations of the accumulated linkage and association studies, there are
115            good suggestions that these studies have identified plausible candidate genes for
116            schizophrenia. Table 2 summarizes the evidence in support of a set of possible candidate
117            genes for schizophrenia. Reports supporting the role of many of these genes have appeared
118            in top-tier international journals known for rigorous peer review. The evidence for several
119            genes is encouraging but currently insufficient to declare any a clear-cut cause of
120            schizophrenia.
121            The accumulated data provide particular support for 
122            DISC1 , 
123            DTNBP1 , 
124            NRG1 , and 
125            RGS4 . Each of these genes has received support from multiple lines of
126            evidence with imperfect consistency: 1) The case for each of these as a candidate gene for
127            schizophrenia is supported by linkage studies; 2) The preponderance of association study
128            findings provides further support; 3) mRNA from each gene is expressed in the prefrontal
129            cortex as well as in other areas of the brain; and 4) Additional neurobiological data link
130            the functions of these genes to biological processes thought to be related to
131            schizophrenia. For example, 
132            DISC1 modulates neurite outgrowth, there is an extensive literature on
133            the involvement of 
134            NRG1 in the development of the CNS, and 
135            RGS4 may modulate intracellular signaling for many G-protein-coupled
136            receptors. Moreover, 
137            DTNBP1 and 
138            RGS4 have been reported to be differentially expressed in postmortem
139            brain samples of individuals with schizophrenia.
140            This encouraging summation of work in progress masks a critical issue—the lack or
141            consistent replication for the same markers and haplotypes across studies. The literature
142            supports the contention that genetic variation in these genes is associated with
143            schizophrenia, but it lacks impressive consistency in the precise genetic regions and
144            alleles implicated. In contrast, association studies of other complex human genetic
145            diseases have produced unambiguous, consistent, and clear-cut (“hard”) replication. For
146            example, 1) in Type 1 diabetes mellitus, the bulk of both the linkage and association data
147            implicate the 
148            HLA region and 
149            INS [22]; 2) for Type 2 diabetes mellitus, there are a number of findings
150            in the literature where the association evidence appears to be consistent and compelling (
151            CAPN10 , 
152            KCNJ11 , and 
153            PPARG )—the data indicate that the same marker allele is significantly
154            associated and has an effect size of similar direction and magnitude [22] (the linkage data
155            are less congruent, probably due to power considerations); and 3) for age-related macular
156            degeneration, at least five studies show highly significant association with the same 
157            CFH Y402H polymorphism [23–27] in a region strongly implicated by
158            multiple linkage studies. For these findings, the data are highly compelling and consistent
159            and provide a solid foundation for the next generation of studies to investigate the
160            mechanisms of the gene–phenotype connection. Power/type 2 error appears to be a major
161            factor—if the genetic effect is sufficiently large (
162            HLA in Type 1 diabetes mellitus or 
163            CFH in age-related macular degeneration)—or, if the sample size is large,
164            then there appears to be a greater chance of “hard” replication.
165            At present, the data for schizophrenia are confusing, and there are two broad
166            possibilities. The first possibility is that the current findings for some of the best
167            current genes are true. This implies that the genetics of schizophrenia are different from
168            other complex traits in the existence of very high degrees of etiological heterogeneity:
169            schizophrenia is hyper-complex, and we need to invoke more complicated genetic models than
170            other biomedical disorders. The alternative possibility is that the current findings are
171            clouded by Type 1 and Type 2 error. Schizophrenia is similar to other complex traits: it is
172            possible that there are kernels of wheat, but it is highly likely that there is a lot of
173            chaff. At present, the second and more parsimonious possibility has not been rigorously
174            excluded. The impact of Type 1/Type 2 error is likely, and it is not clear why
175            schizophrenia should be inherently more complex. At present, we cannot resolve these
176            possibilities.
177          
178          
179            Public Health Implications
180            The public health importance of schizophrenia is clear, and the rationale for the search
181            for genetic causes is strong. Schizophrenia research has never been easy: the current epoch
182            of investigation into the genetics of schizophrenia provides a set of tantalizing clues,
183            but definitive answers are not yet fully established. Findings from the accumulated
184            literature appear to be more than chance yet sufficiently variable as to render “hard”
185            replication elusive. The currently murky view of this literature may result from the
186            competing filters of Type 1 and Type 2 error. The current literature could be a mix of true
187            and false positive findings; however, it would be a momentous advance for the field if even
188            one of the genes in Table 2 were a true positive result.
189            This body of work is not yet ready for wholesale translation into clinical practice.
190            However, it is not premature to inform patients that this work is advancing and that it
191            holds promise for new insights into etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment on the five-
192            to ten-year horizon. On a larger scale, the treatment of the mentally ill mirrors the
193            humanity of a society; in many societies, the return image is not flattering. If a specific
194            genetic variation were proven to be causal to schizophrenia, this poor reflection might
195            improve [28].
